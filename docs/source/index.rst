flower: Flexible Library of Organic Workflows and Extensible Recipes
===============================================


flower is a modular “wrapper” package for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation pipeline development, designed to enable fast, reproducible, end-to-
end simulation workflows with minimal user effort. An object-oriented design
makes flower extensible and highly flexible. This is bolstered by a
library-based approach to system initialization, making flower agnostic
to system identity, forcefield, and thermodynamic ensemble, and allowing
for growth on an as-needed basis.
