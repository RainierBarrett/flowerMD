    "HOOMD-Organics uses [`HOOMD-blue`](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/v4.1.0/) simulation engine in the background to run different methods of simulation and utilizes many functionalities from [`mBuild`](https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/) and [GMSO](https://gmso.mosdef.org/en/stable/) packages to initialize the structures, apply force-fields and prepare necessary information to run a simulation.\n",

    "-  `Molecule`: This class is used to define the structure of a molecule (for example the structure of a polymer built from a monomer). This class allows us to implement recipies for building complex structures.\n",

    "- `System`: This class is used to assemble molecules into a box and to capture the initial `gsd` snapshot of the system. It also applies the forcefiled to the system and prepares the required forces for the simulation.\n",

    "- `Simulation`: This class is used to run the simulation using the `HOOMD-blue` simulation engine. In order to initialize a simulation, a `gsd` snapshot of the system and a list of `Hoomd` forces are required."

In such cases, they should skip passing the `force_field` parameter during system setup and instead provide it directly to the `Simulation` class in the subsequent step. This approach allows for a greater flexibility in customizing the force interactions within the simulation, specially in cases where XML-based forcefield are not available.
